# SmartRoute
SmartRoute is a simple web app that helps drivers plan the best pickup and drop-off route for students. Enter your start point, add up to six pickup stops, and a final school destination. The app calculates the most efficient order, shows the route on a map, and lets you open it in Google Maps for turn-by-turn navigation.
